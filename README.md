### *Slide 1: Title Slide*

*Speaking Material:*

> "Good \[morning/afternoon]! We are proud to present EventSync. I’m \[Your Name], and I’m joined by \[Team Members’ Names]. Our project focuses on simplifying and digitizing event coordination through a centralized platform designed for both organizers and attendees."

---

### *Slide 2: Overview*

*Speaking Material:*

> "EventSync is a collaborative event management platform. Our goal is to replace scattered manual processes with a unified, user-friendly system that streamlines everything from event creation and registration to resource booking and payments. It ensures a better experience for everyone involved."

### *Slide 3: Architectural Styles*

*Speaking Material:*

> "We used two major architectural styles:
> 
>* First, the *Client-Server model*, where the client handles user interaction and the server processes requests.
> * Second, a *Microservices architecture*, which breaks the application into independent services like authentication, event handling, and payments — making the system modular and easier to maintain or scale."

### *Slide 4: Client-Server Model*

*Speaking Material:*

> "Here you can see a visualization of the Client-Server model. It illustrates how user requests are handled at the front-end, passed to the server, and how the server responds, allowing efficient communication between modules."

### *Slide 20: Conclusion*

*Speaking Material:*

> "In summary, EventSync taught us the importance of sprint planning, modular design using microservices, and real-world challenges like payment integration. Most importantly, it improved our collaboration and prepared us for future software engineering projects."
